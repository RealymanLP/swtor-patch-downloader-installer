The program is written in Python and should run without any program instalations.

 1. Open the file "patchdownloader_installer.exe"
 2. Select the product
 3. Select the environment
 4. Select the language
 5. Check "Search for new version?", if you want the program to automatically check for a new version.
    If a new version is found, old version information is renamed and numbered.
 6. Chose the location, where you want to save the files. You have to use "/" instead of "\"
    Use the button "Select Directory" to select it directly
 7. Select the Download-file-structure.
    cdn - Downloaded files will get sorted like on the cdn. Good to create a copy of the cdn.
    subdirectorys - Downloaded files will get sorted in subdirectorys -> /{env}/{product}/{files}
    root - Downloaded files will get downloaded directly into the selected directory
 8. Check "Download other version?" and click "Search all versions" to get other builds of the
    selected version.
 9. OPTIONAL If you want to install the downloaded files directly, check "Install files?"
10. OPTIONAL Chose the location, where you want to have the patch installed.
11. Click "Download & Install" to get the patch.
    Click "See creation date" to see the date, when the version got released (probably not correct 
    at the moment)

Console Mode:
1. Open cmd.exe in the current dirctory.
2. Run "patchdownloader_newlauncher.exe -?"
3. Run "patchdownloader_newlauncher.exe" with the given parameters to download (and install)
   your version
